## 🔒 Firebase Integration

This portfolio uses Firebase services to:

- 📬 **Store Contact Messages**: Visitors can send messages which are securely stored in Firestore.
- 📈 **Track Page Views**: Visitor analytics are updated in real-time via Firebase Analytics & Firestore.
- 📥 **Newsletter Subscribers**: Emails are validated and stored.
- 📄 **Resume Downloads**: Tracks download intent with basic fingerprinting (IP, device info).

> 🔐 API keys are not exposed publicly. Ensure you configure your own `firebase-config.js` safely.
